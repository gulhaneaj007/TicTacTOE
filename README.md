The provided code is a React functional component called `OuterBox`, which implements a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game. Let's break down the logical description of the code step by step:

1. Import Statements:
   - The code imports necessary modules from React, including `useState`, and a custom component called `Square` from './Square' (presumably a square component used for each cell in the Tic-Tac-Toe board).

2. State Initialization:
   - The component uses two state variables initialized using the `useState` hook:
     - `state`: It represents the current state of the Tic-Tac-Toe board, initialized as an array of 9 elements with `null` values, indicating that all cells are initially empty.
     - `xTurn`: A boolean variable that keeps track of the current player's turn. When it's `true`, it means it's 'X' player's turn, and when it's `false`, it's 'O' player's turn.

3. Winner Logic:
   - The function `chkWinner()` checks for a winning combination on the board using an array of arrays called `winner`. Each inner array represents a winning combination of cell indices that would lead to a win in Tic-Tac-Toe. It iterates through these combinations and checks if any of them have the same value ('X' or 'O') in all three cells. If such a combination is found, the function returns the value ('X' or 'O') indicating the winner. If no winner is found, the function returns `undefined`.

4. Handling Clicks:
   - The function `handleClick(index)` is called when a player clicks on a cell in the Tic-Tac-Toe board. It takes the index of the clicked cell as input.
   - First, it creates a shallow copy of the current `state` array using the spread operator (`...state`). This is done to avoid directly mutating the state array, as React requires immutable updates for state variables.
   - It then checks whether it's 'X' player's turn or 'O' player's turn and updates the copied state array with the corresponding player's mark ('X' or 'O') at the clicked cell index.
   - After updating the state, it toggles the `xTurn` variable using `setXturn(!xTurn)`, which switches the turn to the next player.

5. Rendering the Board:
   - The `OuterBox` component renders the Tic-Tac-Toe board using three rows, each containing three `Square` components.
   - Each `Square` component is responsible for displaying the value at a specific cell in the board (either 'X', 'O', or `null` for an empty cell).
   - The `handleClick` function is passed as a callback to each `Square` component, so when a cell is clicked, it updates the state accordingly.
   
6. Displaying the Winner:
   - The result of the `chkWinner()` function is stored in the `result` variable.
   - The `h4` tag displays the result as "Winner is : {result}". If there is a winner, it will show the player ('X' or 'O') who won; otherwise, it will display `undefined`.

The code creates a fully functional Tic-Tac-Toe game using React and demonstrates how to handle state and user interactions to build a simple interactive application.
